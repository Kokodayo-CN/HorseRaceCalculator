# GTA Online Horse Race Calculator  

## What can it do?  
This program can calculate the actual odds for winning in horse races on GTA Online, allowing players to make better decision based on staistical results.  
Player is required to enter the odds of winning for all six horses. If the provided horse combination does not violate the game algorithm, the program will automatically calculate the actual odds of winning for each horse, and suggest the player whether this race is profitable or not.  
The program will also process and suggest the most secure horse with the highest winning possibility. If the game is generally profitable, the program will also suggest a more risky, but generally secure horse with better payout.  
Player can use the calculated results to get a better picture of the current race, instead of being stuck on abstract odd figures.  

## How to use it?

## Whan it CANNOT do?  
This program can only calculate the actual **POSSIBILITIES** of winning for each race. It **DOES NOT** guarantee that the horse with the highest possibility of winning will actually win.  
And in GTA Online, there is **NEVER** any guaranteed method allowing players to win every time, besides money glitches which often leads to account resets.
