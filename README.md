# GTA Online Horse Race Calculator  
[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Kokodayo-CN/HorseRaceCalculator?label=stable&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Kokodayo-CN/HorseRaceCalculator/releases/latest)
## WARNING  
This project is no longer maintained by the developer. While it's functionalities will remain intact, if in further GTA Online updates more horses get added, or if odds link to horses change, those updates will not reflect on this Calulator.  
In future update, the Calculator will allow user to edit the horse list independently without having to rely on updates, in case such situation happens.  
### Why?
Some motherf**ker on some public session got me banned AGAIN, so f*ck you Rockstar.  
## What Can It Do?  
The Calculator can calculate the actual odds for winning in horse races on GTA Online, allowing players to make better decision based on staistical results.  
To initialize data required for a race, player is required to manually enter the odds of winning for all six horses. Player can also click on the "NOT SPECIFIED" text and select the horses by names from the dropdown list.  
If the provided horse combination does not violate the game algorithm, the Calculator will automatically calculate the actual odds of winning for each horse, and suggest the player whether this race is profitable or not.  
The Calculator will also process and suggest the most secure horse with the highest winning possibility. If the game is generally profitable, the Calculator will also suggest a more risky, but generally secure horse with better payout.  
Player can use the calculated results to get a better picture of the current race, instead of being stuck on abstract odd figures.  

## How To Use It?  
Simply head to "Release" and download "Calculator.exe" from the latest release. You can then run the Calculator directly without installation or Internet connection. The Calculator may spend longer time when booting up for the first time for initialization. This is normal, and booting time for subsequent launches will be shorter.  
Windows Defender may prompt and warn that this program is unrecognized. This is because that the Calculator is downloaded online, and I refuse to start a new business and spend hundreds on a yearly basis just to get a certificate from Microsoft. It does not indicate that the Calculator contains any malicious code. Simply select "More Info", then select "Run Anyway".  

## Whan It CANNOT Do?  
The Calculator can only calculate the actual **POSSIBILITIES** of winning for each race. It **DOES NOT** guarantee that the horse with the highest possibility of winning will actually win.  
And in GTA Online, there is **NEVER** any guaranteed method allowing players to win every time, besides money glitches which often leads to account resets.  

## Other Reminders  
Gambling is always discouraged, no matter online or offline. Despite the Horse Racing Game in GTA Online does not directly consumes real money, it is still possible to use real money to purchase digital currencies that could be used in the game, and can be used in the Horse Racing Game. Besides, the Horse Racing Game, and all gambling games (include gacha in other games), will cause psychological impact on players, leading to addiction in gambling. Please gamble reasonably, and request mental support when necessary.
